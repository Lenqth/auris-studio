# Model training integration

The saved-project MCP and live agents use the same session commands. Dataset
storage, labels, source-work splits, inference and replay policy belong to the
collector. Retrieve `capabilities` and MCP `tools/list` at the start of a run;
`tool_schemas` contains per-tool groups and SHA-256 schema hashes, with a catalog
hash for the enabled tool set. Preserve the exact schemas alongside the run.

## Exact analysis output

`render` accepts an optional `analysis` object. This uses the existing immutable
snapshot, cancellation, permission and no-replace publication gates:

```json
{
  "destination": {"kind": "mix", "path": "C:/Dataset/example.wav"},
  "analysis": {
    "sample_rate": 48000,
    "range": {"unit": "frames", "start": 0, "end": 14400000},
    "manifest_path": "C:/Dataset/example.manifest.json"
  }
}
```

Output is stereo float32 WAV, with no gain change, clipping, normalization or
dither. Finite samples outside full scale are retained. Each range is at most
300 seconds; seconds can be used as `{"unit":"seconds","start":1.025,"end":2.5}`.
Seconds round to the nearest output frame. Frame indices use the requested output
rate and the end is exclusive. The output is not subject to `listen`'s short bar
limits. All requested frames are emitted, including silence beyond the score.
Do not also supply the ordinary bar `range`, `include_tail`, or a delivery ceiling.

`track` selects an existing source or bus through its solo routing, inserts,
fader, sends and master. A stem destination exports each source through that same
routing; summing independently rendered wet stems need not equal the full mix.
`dry:true` requires one source track and bypasses its mixer, inserts, sends, bus
routing and master processing. Instrument controls, note performance and clip
processing remain active. It does not mean an acoustic instrument's internal dry
microphone signal. Use separate explicit renders for vocal and accompaniment parts.

`context_from_start:true` processes from timeline zero and discards frames before
the requested start, retaining causal effect context. `looping:true` instead warms
up the requested cycle using the engine's cycle/tail rules. The two are mutually
exclusive. No extra tail is appended: include the desired release in the explicit
range. The manifest records these choices and the exact source-frame mapping.

Audio rendering streams processing blocks. Encoded loudness inspection and input
validation have bounded whole-waveform allocations; a request is not an arbitrary
length streaming protocol. Existing decoder and sample allocation limits apply.

The manifest and WAVs are persistent outputs, independent of audition caches.
Publication refuses stale document/plugin states or changed resolved dependencies.
A multi-file publication error identifies files already published. Copy outputs
into the collector's own durable storage before removing their chosen directory.

The manifest binds all files to document and render-snapshot hashes, session and
document identities, build/binary identity, tempo/meter maps, automation, source
range, signal route and encoded byte hashes. Source and encoded measurements are
separate. Ordinary protected `render` output also reports its source measurement
and actual attenuation. Render snapshots capture current hosted patch states and
parameters without changing the source document. Plugin metadata includes format,
vendor/version when available and state identity. Source files, SoundFonts, plugin
files/bundles and singer entry configurations are hashed without copying
their contents into the manifest. `loaded_audio` fingerprints decoded buffers
actually available to the render, separately from files on disk. Missing/unreadable
references and guide/stale vocals are reported; unavailable render processors fail
analysis export. A hash of a connection file identifies that configuration, not the
remote engine's model files. Determinism remains explicitly uncertified.

## Agreed audio input

Configure `AURIS_AUDIO_INPUT_CONTRACT` with a JSON agreement for the selected native
OpenAI-compatible audio model and reviewer. For example:

```json
{
  "sample_rates": [48000],
  "channel_order": ["left", "right"],
  "sample_formats": ["float32", "pcm24"],
  "max_seconds": 300,
  "max_bytes": 134217728,
  "max_total_bytes": 268435456,
  "max_inputs": 2,
  "simultaneous_comparison": true
}
```

Set this only after agreeing with the model server about its decoder and context
handling. A client-side agreement does not prove that a server or model uses both
channels. Verify decoded values at that server's model boundary. The bundled
16 kHz mono review models retain their own preprocessing; they are different input
contracts from a custom 48 kHz stereo model.

The expanded performance schema also consumes model context. Configure enough
context for the catalog and audio together; the native guard refuses an estimated
over-budget request. CPU full-catalog transport fixtures use a 64k context setting;
this does not establish the real model's audio-context capacity.

Under an agreement, complete original WAV bytes are validated and passed unchanged
in one request. Mono/stereo order, sample representation, duration and byte limits
are checked. Incompatibility fails with no resampling, downmixing, clipping or
truncation. Up to 512 MiB combined container bytes are allowed, including enough
space for two 300-second 48 kHz stereo float32 WAVs. Base64/JSON adds memory and
transport overhead. Review results include transfer hashes, actual format,
per-input frames, zero gain, conversion flags and simultaneous versus independent
comparison status. Explicit agreements fix reviewer selection to the configured
endpoint/model. Existing network and model-loading permission gates still apply.

Native audio attachments use the same contract. Reference-only CLI backends keep
their existing local-analysis path. An external controller can feed a published
render to the next inference step using its manifest path/hash and the agreed input
route. File access and network delivery remain subject to that controller's
existing permission gates. `review_audio_with_contract` also accepts an agreement
explicitly through the session library.

## External multitrack drafts

Use `import_transcription` with `multitrack`, or `path` to a bounded local JSON file.
For example, the multitrack value is:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "source": {
    "audio_sha256": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
    "start_seconds": 10.0,
    "end_seconds": 12.0
  },
  "recognizer": {"name": "external", "model": "my-model"},
  "tracks": [{
    "name": "Bass", "instrument": null, "program": 32,
    "role": "bass", "drums": false,
    "notes": [{"pitch": 24, "start": 10.25, "end": 11.5,
               "strength": 0.7, "confidence": 0.8}]
  }]
}
```

Pass `preview:true` first, then supply both its `revision` as `expected_revision`
and its `preview_digest` when applying. Both are mandatory for multitrack versions
1 and 2, including file inputs. The digest binds the normalized complete draft,
name, insertion tick, instrument assignments and performance settings. Whitespace
changes to JSON are harmless; changed notes, source identity, mappings, placement
or file contents require another preview. Preview always returns the current
revision without editing or requiring a person to approve it. Apply errors contain
`error.code` (`transcription_revision_required`, `transcription_revision_mismatch`,
`transcription_preview_required`, `transcription_preview_mismatch`) and
`error.repreview_required:true`. Rejection leaves the document and history unchanged.
Legacy `transcription` piano drafts retain optional revision checking and do not
require a digest. This compatibility boundary does not apply to multitrack files.

`at_tick` maps `source.start_seconds` onto the destination
timeline, retaining its tempo/meter maps, overlap and velocity. `sound_id` on each
part explicitly maps a playback sound from instrument search. Unknown instrument
labels remain unknown; an omitted sound uses a reported guide. All notes are
validated before any edit, including tick-resolution collapse. Any mapping failure
rolls back the whole import. Acceptance is one Undo step. The declared draft,
confidence, model hashes, constraints and provenance persist in the project's
`transcription_provenance`, keyed by its first imported clip. They establish neither
recognizer authenticity nor musical accuracy. Unknown fields are rejected. Legacy
piano drafts remain accepted through their existing boundary.

### Version-two performance

Version 1 remains notes-only. Version 2 requires `performance`; its complete
fixed example is [transcription-v2.json](../crates/auris-session/tests/fixtures/transcription-v2.json).
All event seconds refer to the original audio. Source tempo anchors explicitly pair
seconds and source-relative musical ticks at 960 ticks per quarter; anchors must
agree within one microsecond. Tempo is piecewise constant, 10..999 BPM. Meter
changes must fall on exact source bar boundaries; invalid maps are rejected.
`preserve_destination` maps seconds through the existing destination tempo map and
keeps both destination maps. `replace_destination` explicitly replaces both global
maps, affecting existing music too, and requires source second zero and insertion
tick zero. Preview reports `replaces_global_maps`. No map changes are implicit.

Each `performance.parts` entry corresponds to one root part and declares its
original zero-based MIDI channel (0..15). Parts become separate instrument routes;
channel identity remains in provenance. Bend values are absolute semitone offsets
within the declared positive range, at most 12 semitones. MIDI CC numbers are
0..127 and values are normalized 0..1. CC 64 is the sustain pedal. Curves use
explicit `linear` interpolation with endpoint holds. Other interpolation modes
are rejected. Every curve includes source start and source end, with an explicit
matching `end_value`; no reset is invented. Control points must remain distinct
after conversion to destination ticks. Clip length includes all controls and one
tick after the terminal control, retaining pedal/control tails after note-off.

Lyric spans identify ordered, nonoverlapping source notes and their exact outer
time bounds. `written`, optional `reading`, per-note IPA `phonemes`, confidence
and recognizer identity stay distinct in persisted provenance. Lyric parts create
singer tracks with a guide voice, preserving the complete written lyric on the
first addressed note and `+` on continuations. Supplied IPA is retained per note;
no reading or phoneme text replaces the written lyric. An explicit instrument
sound assignment or drums cannot also request singer lyrics. Importing control
or lyric events establishes score semantics, not an instrument's acoustic response.

## Synthesis evidence

New singer takes retain immutable `provenance`, which analysis manifests also
expose as `synthesis_provenance`. Evidence includes backend, engine/model/speaker/
style components, available versions/builds/model SHA-256, requested seed and its
support status, synthesis settings, complete input identity, native sample hash
and the encoded take WAV hash. Native sample hashes cover mono float32
little-endian sample bytes at the recorded sample rate. `local_hash`,
`local_observation`, `server_declaration` and `unknown` distinguish the evidence.
Missing fields remain explicit; old takes report unknown without contacting a server.

Local acoustic/vocoder and available variance model hashes are captured when
loading. Configuration hashes are separate from model hashes. VOICEVOX samples
optional, bounded `/version`, `/engine_manifest` and `/singers` metadata after
each synthesis, with short timeouts. Speaker UUID/version, selected decoder style
and query style are retained. Servers may additionally declare `model_id`,
`model_version`, `model_sha256` on the selected style or speaker, plus `build_id`
on the engine manifest. These are server claims observed after synthesis, not an
attestation that a server used a particular artifact for every request or chunk.
Unavailable metadata stays unknown. A changing server updates a new take's record;
loading an older take never refreshes its identity. No model files are copied.

## Transition evidence

The live, session-scoped `execution_trace` uses `operation:{"kind":"start"}` to explicitly enable collection
through the host permission gate. `read` accepts an optional `after` sequence; `stop`
disables collection. The session retains 1024 events and reports evictions and its
last sequence, so a collector can detect gaps and persist its own journal.

Events contain timestamps, origin, operation, before/after state and numeric
revision, successful/failed calls and human/frontend edit boundaries. The desktop
host supplies exact tool call IDs, results and permission outcomes. Published audio
references and byte hashes are recorded after publication. Other hosts can use
`record_execution_call` and `record_execution_outcome` for their own IDs and outcomes.
Arguments, response bodies, prompts, credentials and unrelated file contents are
excluded. The collector owns authorized exact call payloads needed for replay,
human preference attribution and dataset policy. Replay must compare current schema
hashes and stop/report incompatibility before executing recorded calls.

Trace schema version 2 separates `permission_request` / `permission_outcome` from
terminal `host_outcome`. Permission events carry the independent `permission_id`,
original `call_id` and tool, explicit origin and normalized operation name.
Multiple checks can reference one invocation; allowing or denying a check does
not remove its pending call. Cancellation closes outstanding checks and calls
separately. Permissions without a transport-provided invocation use an explicit
`independent` origin and null call ID. Embedded MCP execution uses its own
`live-mcp-*` invocation IDs, distinct from CLI model-side observations.
